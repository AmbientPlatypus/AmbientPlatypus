## Introduction

Trend Micro's open-source integrations will allow organizations to seamlessly integrate their security tools and enhance their threat intelligence capabilities. Our Vision One solution is designed to structure, store, and visualize both technical and non-technical information about cyber threats.

Our Vision One platform includes a modern web application with a Lucerne query API and a user-friendly front-end for easy navigation and access to critical data. Our solution is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for seamless integration with other tools and applications.

Our open-source integrations provide a robust and scalable solution for managing and sharing threat intelligence, enabling organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats and proactively defend their networks.

## Objective

Trend's Vision One aims to provide users with a comprehensive toolset to capitalize on technical and non-technical information related to cyber threats. These tools are designed to link each piece of information to its primary source, such as a report or a MISP event while allowing the user to establish links between each piece of information and track first and last-seen dates and levels of confidence. This tool uses Trend Micro's own open-source integrations, including the MITRE ATT&CK framework, to help structure the data. The user can also choose to implement their own datasets.

After data processing, new associations may be inferred from existing ones to facilitate the understanding and representation of the information. This processing allows the user to extract and leverage meaningful knowledge from the raw data. Trend Micro's Vision One product also allows importing TAXII and MISP feeds and exporting data in different formats, such as CSV and STIX2 bundles. Connectors are actively being developed to accelerate interactions between the tool and other platforms, which is where you can help.
